Face Recognition Based Attendance Monitoring System
This project is a Face Recognition Based Attendance Monitoring System built using Python, Flask, and Jupyter Notebook. The system uses facial recognition technology to automate attendance tracking, making it more efficient and less error-prone than traditional methods.

Features
Real-Time Face Detection: Uses OpenCV and machine learning models to detect faces in real-time.
Face Recognition: Identifies registered faces and logs their attendance.
Flask Integration: Provides a web-based interface for managing the attendance system.
Jupyter Notebook: Offers an interactive platform for running the face recognition training model, visualizing data, and refining the algorithm.

Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language for implementing facial recognition and handling logic.
Flask: Web framework used to build the interface for the system.
OpenCV: Library for real-time computer vision and face detection.
Jupyter Notebook: Used for training and fine-tuning the face recognition model.
